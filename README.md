## Level Design
All levels must have a room for the reaper, which cannot be exited but can be entered one-way by ghosts once they finish the level. Any number of traps may be created, but can only be one-use. You should be able to see out of the room, but not in. Players have rigidbodies in order to provide accurate physics within the level.
